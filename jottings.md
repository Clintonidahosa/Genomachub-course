## Central Dogma: DNA >> RNA >> Protein
- Information flows from DNA to RNA to Protein.
- **Note**: Information is never passed from proteins to nucleic acids.

## Nucleotide Bases
- **Purines**: Adenine (A) and Guanine (G) – Two carbon-nitrogen rings.
- **Pyrimidines**: Thymine (T) and Cytosine (C) – One carbon-nitrogen ring.
- In RNA, **Thymine** is replaced with **Uracil** (U).

## Genomic Comparisons
- **Bacteria**: Approximately 600,000 base pairs.
- **Human and Mouse**: Approximately 3 billion base pairs.
- **Genome**: The complete set of genes within an organism.

## Key Genomics Technologies
- **Sanger Sequencing**: Traditional method used for sequencing DNA.
- **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)**: Allows parallel sequencing of millions of DNA fragments.
- **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)**: Amplifies DNA.
- **Microarray Technology**: Allows for simultaneous analysis of expression levels of thousands of genes.
- **CRISPR**: Enables precise modification of genes within an organism's DNA.

## The Process of Genomics Research
1. **Sample Collection**
2. **DNA Extraction**
3. **Amplification** (Optional)
4. **DNA Sequencing**
5. **Data Generation**
6. **Data Analysis** using bioinformatics tools

## Bioinformatics File Formats
- Standardized structures for storing and organizing biological data in digital files.
  - Examples: **FASTA**, **FASTQ**, **Genbank**, **GFF**

## Terminologies in Genomics
- **Genome Assembly**: Piecing together short DNA reads to create a complete genome.
- **Variant Calling**: Identifying genetic variations such as SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) and Indels (Insertions and Deletions).
- **Functional Annotation**: Determining the role of genes and non-coding regions.
- **Comparative Genomics**: Studying similarities and differences across species.
- **Metagenomics**: Studying the genetic material of microbial communities and ecosystems.
