Module 1
DNA >> RNA >> Protein. (Information is never passed from proteins to nucleic acids)
Nucleotide bases- purines(Adenine and guanine) with 2 carbon-nitrogen rings AND pyrimidine (thymine and cytosine) with 1 carbon nitrogen ring. 
In RNA, Thymine is replaced with uracil
Bacteria has about 600,000 base pairs  while human and mouse genomes contain about 3 billion. 
Genome is the complete set of genes within an organism.
Some key genomics technologies- Sanger sequencing( traditional method used for sequencing DNA)
                                Next generation sequencing (allows parallel sequencing of millions of DNA fragements)
                                PCR
                                Microarray technology (allows for simultaneous analysis of expression levels of thousands of genes)
                                CRISPR (Enables precise modification of genes within an organism's DNA)
THE PROCESS - Sample collection
              DNA extraction 
              Amplification (optional)
              DNA sequencing 
              Data generation 
              Data analysis using bioinformatics tools
Bioinformatics file format - the standardized structure for storing and organizing biological data in a digital file e.g FASTA, FASTQ, Genbank, GFF, 
TERMINOLOGIES
-Genome assembly - piecing together short DNA reads to create a complete genome
-Variant calling - identifying genetic variations such as SNPs and Indels
-Functional annotation - determining the role of genes and non- coding regions 
-Comparative genomics - studying similarities and differences across species 
-Metagenomics - studying the genetic material of microbial communities and ecosystems
